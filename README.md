# IccTA_MySQL_Linker

This code snippet can help to read Intent and Component information from IccTA generated MySQL database. After that, 
it will generate the data for Links table in the mentioned database. This work can be done using pure MySQL code as well. 
We use Python so that we can have additional processing of information if needed.

To run this you need to have Python 2.7 or later. Not compatible with Python 3.0 or later. 
Additional dependency: Python MySQL Connector (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/)
